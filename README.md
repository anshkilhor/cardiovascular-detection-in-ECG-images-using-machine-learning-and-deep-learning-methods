Artificial intelligence plays an important role
 in improving the quality of life. In particular, early detection
 of diseases can help save lives. In this work, the proposed new
 lightweight CNN architecture has improved the accuracy rate
 of cardiovascular disease classification to 98.23% compared with
 the existing state-of-the-art methods, using the dataset of ECG
 images of cardiac patients, and can be performed on a single CPU,
 overcoming the limitation of computational power. In addition, the
 classification accuracy has significantly improved after applying
 the proposed method as a feature extraction tool for traditional
 machine learning algorithms. For example, an accuracy of 99.79%
 has been achieved using the Na√Øve Bayes algorithm. Thus, this
 method could be integrated into the IoT ecosystem in healthcare.
 This will encourage other AI researchers to explore other methods
 for cardiovascular disease detection.
